'''
Get user input using input(“Enter your age: ”). If user is 18 or older, give feedback: You are old enough to drive. 
If below 18 give feedback to wait for the missing amount of years. Output:
'''
# age = input('please enter your age')
# if (int(age) >= 18):
#     print('you are old enough to learn to drive')
# else:
#     print(f'You need {18 - int(age)} more years to learn to drive.')


'''
Compare the values of my_age and your_age using if … else. Who is older (me or you)? Use input(“Enter your age: ”) to get the age as input.
You can use a nested condition to print 'year' for 1 year difference in age, 'years' for bigger differences, and a custom text 
if my_age = your_age. Output:
'''
# your_age = int(input('please enter your age'))
# my_age = 20

# if (my_age > your_age):
#     print(f'you are {my_age - your_age} years younger than me')
# elif(my_age == your_age):
#     print('we are the same age')
# else:
#     print(f'you are {your_age - my_age} years older than me')

'''Get two numbers from the user using input prompt. If a is greater than b return a is greater than b, if a is less b return a is smaller than b,
else a is equal to b. Output:'''

# num1 = input('Enter a number one')
# num2 = input('Enter a number two')

# if (num1 > num2):
#     print('a is greater than b')
# elif (num1 < num2):
#     print('a is less than b')
# else:
#     print('a is equal to b')
